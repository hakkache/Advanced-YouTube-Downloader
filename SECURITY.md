## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT Create a Public Issue
Security vulnerabilities should not be reported in public GitHub issues, as this could put users at risk.

### 2. Report Privately
Send security reports to: **security@[project-email]** (or create a private security advisory on GitHub)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact and severity
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations
- Your contact information for follow-up

### 3. Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Investigation**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Within 30 days (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

### 4. Responsible Disclosure
We follow responsible disclosure practices:
- We will acknowledge your report promptly
- We will keep you updated on our progress
- We will credit you in our security advisory (if desired)
- We will coordinate public disclosure timing with you

## Security Considerations

### User Responsibilities

#### Safe Usage
- **Verify URLs**: Only download from trusted YouTube URLs
- **Check Downloads**: Scan downloaded files for malware
- **Update Regularly**: Keep the application updated to the latest version
- **Secure Environment**: Run the application in a secure environment

#### Network Security
- **HTTPS Only**: The application uses HTTPS for all YouTube communications
- **No Credentials**: The application never requests or stores YouTube credentials
- **Local Processing**: All processing happens locally on your machine

### Application Security

#### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- URL validation prevents malicious redirects
- File path validation prevents directory traversal attacks
- Time range inputs are validated to prevent injection

#### File System Security
- Downloads are restricted to designated directories
- File names are sanitized to prevent system file overwrites
- Temporary files are cleaned up after processing
- No execution of downloaded content

#### Network Security
- No data is sent to third parties (except YouTube for downloads)
- No user tracking or analytics
- Local-only web interface (localhost binding)
- No external API calls except for video metadata

### Known Security Considerations

#### YouTube API Dependencies
- The application relies on yt-dlp for YouTube interaction
- Security depends on yt-dlp's security measures
- We monitor yt-dlp security advisories and update accordingly

#### Local Web Server
- Streamlit runs a local web server (default: localhost:8501)
- Access is restricted to localhost by default
- No authentication is implemented (assumes trusted local environment)

#### File Permissions
- Downloaded files inherit system default permissions
- Users should review file permissions for sensitive content
- The application does not modify system-wide security settings

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Environment Security
- Run in a virtual environment when possible
- Keep Python and dependencies updated
- Use antivirus software to scan downloads
- Regularly clean up downloaded files

#### Network Precautions
- Use trusted networks for downloads
- Consider VPN usage in restricted regions
- Be aware of bandwidth monitoring by network administrators
- Avoid downloading on metered connections without proper controls

#### Content Safety
- Only download content you have rights to access
- Be cautious with content from unknown uploaders
- Verify content before sharing or redistribution
- Respect copyright and platform terms of service

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- Regular dependency updates
- Input validation for all user inputs
- Secure file handling practices
- Error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

#### Testing
- Security testing for input validation
- File system security testing
- Network security verification
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

## Vulnerability Categories

### High Priority
- Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- File system access outside designated directories
- Network-based attacks or data exfiltration
- Privilege escalation issues

### Medium Priority
- Local denial of service attacks
- Information disclosure vulnerabilities
- Input validation bypasses
- Authentication/authorization issues (if applicable)

### Low Priority
- Minor information leaks
- UI-based attacks with limited impact
- Performance-based denial of service
- Non-security configuration issues

## Security Updates

### Update Process
1. Security issues are prioritized for immediate attention
2. Fixes are developed and tested thoroughly
3. Security updates are released as patch versions
4. Users are notified through GitHub releases and documentation

### Update Notifications
- Critical security updates are highlighted in release notes
- Users are encouraged to enable GitHub notifications for releases
- Security advisories are published for significant vulnerabilities

### Backward Compatibility
- Security fixes maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Breaking changes are clearly documented and justified
- Migration guides are provided for necessary breaking changes

## Dependencies Security

### Monitoring
We actively monitor our dependencies for security vulnerabilities:
- GitHub Dependabot alerts
- Security advisory databases
- Upstream project security announcements

### Update Policy
- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Immediate updates
- **High severity**: Within 7 days
- **Medium/Low severity**: Next regular release cycle
- **Zero-day vulnerabilities**: Emergency release process

### Dependency Verification
- All dependencies are verified from official sources
- Package integrity is verified during installation
- Dependency versions are pinned for reproducible builds

## Incident Response

### Response Team
Security incidents are handled by the project maintainers with expertise in:
- Application security
- Python ecosystem security
- Web application security
- Incident response procedures

### Response Process
1. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
2. **Containment**: Prevent further exposure
3. **Investigation**: Understand root cause and scope
4. **Resolution**: Develop and test fixes
5. **Communication**: Notify users appropriately
6. **Post-Incident**: Review and improve processes

### Communication
- Security advisories for public vulnerabilities
- Direct communication for users who reported issues
- Clear timeline and impact assessment
- Instructions for users to protect themselves
